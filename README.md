## 🧠 How TN Cutoff Is Calculated

| Subject              | IPE Max Marks | TN Equivalent |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Maths 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B | 75 each (300)   | 100 marks      |
| Physics (Theory + Lab)| 60 + 30 (90)   | 50 marks       |
| Chemistry (Theory + Lab)| 60 + 30 (90) | 50 marks       |

**Formula Used:**

TN_Math = (Math1A + Math1B + Math2A + Math2B) / 3

TN_Physics = (Physics Theory + Physics Practical) / 1.8

TN_Chemistry = (Chemistry Theory + Chemistry Practical) / 1.8

TN_Total = TN_Math + TN_Physics + TN_Chemistry
